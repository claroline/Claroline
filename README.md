This is the official distribution package of the Claroline Connect learning
management system. It is intended to be installed within the
[claroline/Claroline](http://github.com/claroline/Claroline) application and
provides:

1. the core bundles and components needed to get a working platform;
2. the plugin bundles officially supported by the Claroline Consortium.

## TODO

- [ ] check if PdfGeneratorBundle is usable before activation (requires wkhtmltopdf)
- [ ] remove the innova/angular bundles (required by portfolio)
- [ ] remove the front-end-bundle (required by icapbadge for jqplot and by core/Resouces/less/layout.less and by ujmexo)
- [ ] add install and doc sections (require claroline/Claroline to be updated as well)
