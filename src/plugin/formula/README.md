# FormulaPluginBundle
Claroline plugin that adds equation/formula editor to tinymce editor

In order for the plugin to work you need a browser that is capable of svg rendering.
It is also required that in your tinymce configuration you add the following option:
``paste_data_images: true``

# TODO
Remove the js formula plugin sources from Resources/js (try to user bower instead)
