Event Tracking
============

Event Tracking is a system that you can use to record user interaction with platform.

This is accomplished by attaching the appropriate event to the particular action you want to track.
When used this way, all user activity on such actions is calculated and displayed as Events in the Tracking reporting interface.

Event Tracking system can collect four major event categories:

 * User events (user create, update, delete etc.)
 * Group events
 * Resources events
 * Roles events

Advanced features
-------------

In this section we cover what we call “advanced features” of the event tracking process.
These features include:
 * Not repeatable log
 * Mechanisms for displaying plugins’ logs


### Not repeatable log ###

Some events such as resourceRead need to be filtered before storing them to the database
in order to avoid information redundancy. By information redundancy we mean that the same
event even if it occurs many times during a specific period of time it only has to be stored
once.

E.g.: Taking the case of a blog for example. In a blog it is quite possible that a user navigates
though it’s different pages, posts, comments etc. Every time the user navigates a “read Blog”
event occurs (since he is loading another page / item of the same blog).


It is clear that storing all these occurrences is pointless since we only need one to tell us that
a user started reading the resource. For that reason, we choose to store only the first of
these occurrences then wait some time until we store again the same info. The “delay” time
is configurable in the parameters.yml file.

The events that are defined as “Not repeatable” are the following:
 * ResourceRead
 * WorkspaceToolRead

The mechanism behind that functionality does NOT use any database interaction. Instead,
last event occurrence is stored in client’s http session having as value a timestamp (when the
event first occurred).


If this behavior needs to be applied in other events as well, then the created event MUST
implement the NotRepeatableLog interface. The NotRepeatableLog interface requires the
definition of a method called getLogSignature() which generates a unique identifier for this
event’s occurrences. For any resource the unique identifier would has the following form:resource_read_abstractResourceID. For example in the case of a Blog whose id is 42 the
generated signature would be: resource_read_42.

[Creating new event log](#create_new_event)
-------------

There are two ways for creating new event log:
 * Using existing event provided by the CoreBundle
 * Create custom event

Using existing one is quicker but the way it's displayed cannot be change.
And if you use them you won't be able to award badge based on specific plugin's action, just generic one provided by the CoreBundle.
Indeed this event is used in the badge system to know which action can be used to award badge.

Knowing that creating custom event is highly recommended.
So only creation of custom event will be covered in this doc, for using existing one please refer to the CoreBundle code.

For creating new event log here is the step to follow:
 * Create new class that extends the good class
   * AbstractLogResourceEvent when action occured on a resource, or child resource
 * Define a constant in the class whose name begin with `ACTION`, other name won't be used to list available action's log
   This constant must be well formated in two or three sections separated by a dash `-` in order to be used in the filter form.
   Each of this section can match pretty much everything you need.
   Here is an example:
     * first section is the type of object it's associated (platform, resource, workspace, role, tools, widget, user...)
     * second section (`optionnal`) is the type of the resource (for resource type of object by example)
     * third section is the action executed (login, post_create, post_update, post_delete, ws_role_subscribe_user etc...)
   You will need to add some translation text for the first section key and for the `log_%constantName_filter` (e.g. `log_workspace-update_filter` for update action on a workspace).
   Each section will become a choice list ine the filter form.
 * Use this new class with an event dispatcher on the `log` event name and you're done

For now log form filter will just have two select list but you can make three section for future enhancement.

Let's admit you want to create a log for when you create a post in a blog.
Firs create the event class:

```php
<?php

namespace ICAP\BlogBundle\Event\Log;

use Claroline\CoreBundle\Entity\Resource\ResourceNode;
use Claroline\CoreBundle\Event\Log\AbstractLogResourceEvent;
use ICAP\BlogBundle\Entity\Blog;
use ICAP\BlogBundle\Entity\Post;

class LogPostCreateEvent extends AbstractLogResourceEvent
{
    const ACTION = 'resource-icap_blog-post_create';

    public function __construct(Blog $blog, Post $post)
    {
        $details = array(
            'post' => array(
                'blog'  => $blog->getId(),
                'title' => $post->getTitle(),
                'slug'  => $post->getSlug()
            )
        );

        parent::__construct($blog->getResourceNode(), $details);
    }

    /**
     * @return array
     */
    public function getRestriction()
    {
        return array(self::DISPLAYED_WORKSPACE);
    }
}
```

By default all logs are not displayed on vizualisation interface.
To see them you have to define their displaying restirctions.
To do it you have to define the `getRestriction` method on your event log class and make it return an array of where you want it to be displayed.
There is two constants at your disposal in the class, `DISPLAYED_ADMIN` and `DISPLAYED_WORKSPACE`.

Somme classes you can extend of exist to ease the class creation, here is the list and what they are for:
 * `AbstractLogResourceEvent` for event log associate to a resource
 * `AbstractLogToolEvent` for event log associate to a tool
 * `AbstractLogWidgetEvent` for event log associate to a widget

This solution isn't mandatory, but it fills the log with some predetermined datas that you don't have to deal with.

After creating this class you just have to use it in your code where you create your post:

```php
$event = new \ICAP\BlogBundle\Event\Log\LogPostCreateEvent($blog, $post);

$this->get('event_dispatcher')->dispatch('log', $event);
```

And you're good.
All parameters provided to the event is specific to this case, you can of course give what you want to the class,
just don't forget to give the superclass what she needs if you use one of them.

[Displaying new event log](#displaying_event)
-------------

When creating new event log, listeners and functions have to be defined in order to render the new logs.

The listeners that need to be defined are the following:
- create_log_list_item_%actionName% (e.g. create_log_list_item_resource-icap_blog-post_create)
- create_log_details_%actionName% (e.g. create_log_details_resource-icap_blog-post_create)
As well as the functions called by these listeners.


The first listener is responsible for rendering the event in an appropriate form for the events
list (short presentation of the event). An example of this function is given below:

```php
public function onCreateLogListItem(LogCreateDelegateViewEvent $event)
{
    $content = $this->container->get('templating')->render(
        'ICAPBlogBundle::log_list_item.html.twig',
        array('log' => $event->getLog())
    );
    $event->setResponseContent($content);
    $event->stopPropagation();
}
```

The example shows that along with the listener and the function a (twig) view is also
required. In the given example this view is the ‘log_list_item.html.twig’, responsible to display
the event in a short form. Below is given the code of this view:

```php
{% set doer %}
    {% include 'ClarolineCoreBundle:Log:view_list_item_doer.html.twig' %}
{% endset %}

{% set blog %}
    {% include 'ICAPBlogBundle:Log:log_list_item_blog.html.twig' %}
{% endset %}

{% set post %}
    {% include 'ICAPBlogBundle:Log:log_list_item_post.html.twig' %}
{% endset %}

{% set resource %}
    {% include 'ClarolineCoreBundle:Log:view_list_item_resource.html.twig' %}
{% endset %}

{% if constant('ICAP\\BlogBundle\\Event\\Log\\LogPostCreateEvent::ACTION') == log.action %}
    {{ 'log.blog.create_post'|trans({'%blog%': resource, '%post%': post}, 'log')|raw }}
{% elseif constant('ICAP\\BlogBundle\\Event\\Log\\LogPostReadEvent::ACTION') == log.action %}
    {{ 'log.blog.read_post'|trans({'%blog%': resource, '%post%': post}, 'log')|raw }}
{% else %}
    no default text
{% endif %}
```

In addition to this listener you need to define a translation text for the key `log_%actionName%_shortname` in order to
display the action text on the list item row of the log (e.g. for action `resource-icap_blog-post_create` define a
`log_resource-icap_blog-post_create_shortname` key in your log translation file).

The second listener displays the event in details. Hence, both its function and its view are
more complex.

```php
public function onCreateLogDetails(LogCreateDelegateViewEvent $event)
{
    $content = $this->container->get('templating')->render(
        'ICAPBlogBundle::log_details.html.twig',
        array(
            'log' => $event->getLog(),
            'listItemView' => $this->container->get('templating')->render(
                'ICAPBlogBundle::log_list_item.html.twig',
                array('log' => $event->getLog())
            )
        )
    );
    $event->setResponseContent($content);
    $event->stopPropagation();
}
```
The associated view is the ‘log_details.html.twig’ and its code is given below:

```php
{% extends 'ClarolineCoreBundle:Log:view_details.html.twig' %}

{% block logDetailsContext %}
    {{ parent() }}
    {% if constant('ICAP\\BlogBundle\\Event\\Log\\LogPostCreateEvent::ACTION') == log.action %}
        {% include 'ICAPBlogBundle:Log:log_details_post.html.twig' %}
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

You are of course encouraged to extends CoreBundle log base views, and just override the part you want.
To do that you have at your disposal some block that you can customize, by override or to add datas into:
 * logDetailsTitle: the title displayed at the top of the page (display `log_%actionName%_title` trnalsation by default)
 * logDetailsSubtitle: display the same information than in the event list.
 * logDetailsContext: informations about the occured action
