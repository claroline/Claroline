Introduction
------------

In [Claroline][claroline] we use [Bootstrap][bootstrap], [LESS CSS][lesscss]
and [LessPHP][lessphp] in order to create, compile and generate our themes.

Our themes and **Bootstrap** are written in **Less CSS** but you can create a
theme
in flat CSS, Sass, SCSS or with another CSS framework as
[Foundation][foundation], but this documentation will be only focused on
**Bootstrap** and **Less CSS**.

Creating a new theme
--------------------

In order to create a new theme you must first define its *name* and *path* in
the **config.yml** of the plugin.

*ExampleBundle/Resources/config/config.yml*

```yml
themes:
  - name: "ExampleBundle Theme"
    path: "less/example/theme.html.twig"
```

The *path* of the theme is in fact a path to a twig file inside the views
folder of your plugin (ExampleBundle/Resources/views).

This twig file defines a [stylesheet][assets] tag with the informations of
your *css* or *less* file. You can define also a filter as *lessphp* and set
the *path* of the output file that will be stored in the *web* directory.

*ExampleBundle/Resources/views/less/example/theme.html.twig*

```django
{% stylesheets
    debug=false
    filter="lessphp"
    output="bundles/clarolinecore/css/themes/examplebundle-theme/bootstrap.css"
    "@ClarolineExampleBundle/Resources/views/less/example/common.less"
%}
    <link href="{{ asset_url }}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
{% endstylesheets %}
```

In this example
`@ClarolineExampleBundle/Resources/views/less/example/common.less` is the path
of a common file that contains imports of your custom theme files, but also the
import of important **Bootstrap** files.

You can find an example of this common file in our
[ExampleBundle][examplebundle].

In this example there is two more important files for our theme.

- A *variable.less* file which defines all the **Bootstrap** variables that you
  want to overwrite.
- A *theme.less* file which defines additional style rules.

*ExampleBundle/Resources/views/less/example/variable.less*

```css
@navbarInverseLinkColor: #ccc;
@linkColor: darken(@orange, 5%);
@baseBorderRadius: 8px
```

At this point you can use any **Less CSS** and **Bootstrap** function or
variables, as `darken`, `lighten` or `@orange`.
[Here][lesscssfunction] is a function reference of **Less CSS**.

*ExampleBundle/Resources/views/less/example/theme.less*

```css
body
{
    background:@infoBackground;
}

.brand
{
    background:transparent url(../../../images/logo/logo.png) 20px 5px no-repeat;
    padding-left:50px !important;
}
```

In this example the path of the images in the less file are relative of the
compiled output file, if you want to change this you can use a
[cssrewrite][assetsrewrite] filter.

Compiling a theme
-----------------

In order to compile your new theme you need simply to install your plugin in
the **Claroline** platform, then you can chose your new theme in the platform
parameters in administration section.

If your plugin is already installed and you want to compile modifications of
your theme, you can run `php app/console assetic:dump`, this **Symfony2**
command will compile all the themes but not only of your plugin, the themes of
all the bundles and it will install too all the assets.

If you want to compile only one theme of your plugin, you can use our
`claroline:theme:compile` command with the *path* or *name* of your theme as
following:

```sh
php app/console claroline:theme:compile "ExampleBundle Theme"
```

```sh
php app/console claroline:theme:compile ClarolineExampleBundle:less:example/theme.html.twig
```

Note that if the *name* of your theme have spaces you must use quotes.

If you use the command with the *path*, you need to you need to follow the
**Symfony2** convention and use colons to point to the directory of the
resource.

If the *name* or *path* does not exist or if you do not specify it, all the
themes will be compiled.

Overwriting Claroline twig files
--------------------------------

In order to overwrite **Claroline** twig files from your plugin, you need first
to [create a theme](#newtheme) and then create a folder with the same name than
your theme (without spaces and lowercase) in *views*.

The location of the template in this directory must match the location of the
original template in the ClarolineCoreBundle views folder. The twig file that
lives inside the *ClarolineCoreBundle* will be entirely ignored, and your file
will be used instead.

You can find an example of that in our [ExampleBundle][examplebundle].

`src/plugin/Claroline/ExampleBundle/Resources/views/examplebundletheme/Layout/top_bar.html.twig`

*overwrites*

`src/core/Claroline/CoreBundle/Resources/views/Layout/top_bar.html.twig`

That only works if your theme is chosen in platform parameters in the
administration section.

Generating themes
-----------------

We know that for someone who never hear talk about **Less CSS** or
**Bootstrap** maybe could be hard to start to write a theme.

For that case we create simple theme generator, you can find it in the link
*"Create a new theme"* in platform parameters in administration section. There
you can chose the colors to be used in a theme with a simple color picker. In
section of *"more option"* you can change more that only colors.

Note that you must have write permission on following folders:

`src/core/Claroline/CoreBundle/Resources/views/less-generated`

`src/core/Claroline/CoreBundle/Resources/public/css/themes`

When you finish to customize your theme you can simply save it or preview it,
this theme will be compile automatically and can be used instantly in the
platform.

If you dont like the results of a theme, you can simply chose it in theme
generator panel and click in delete button.

The less files of your generated theme are stored in
`src/core/Claroline/CoreBundle/Resources/views/less-generated/`, you can copy
that files as template to start a theme in a plugin, you can simply modify the
file *theme.less* in order to add additional style rules, you can consider that
file as a simple CSS file but you can use at any place **Less CSS** or
**Bootstrap** functions and variables.
