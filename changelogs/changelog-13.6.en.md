Changes and improvements in v13.6

General:

- Overall, performance improvements have been made to the application. They are not necessarily visible from the interface for end users but should notably improve the loading times.
- The "Full screen" mode already available from the resources and tools has been revised to increase your users' immersion in your content. The full screen mode now makes the tools menu on the left and the navigation bar at the top disappear. The cover images and option buttons of the resources and tools are also hidden when switching to full screen.
- A new group "ROLE_USER" has been created, it contains all the users of the platform and will be updated automatically when new users are created. It can be used to automate the registration of new users to a workspace that you wish to make accessible to all.
- Addition of some missing translations
- Cleaning up obsolete features

Import/Export:

- Added export of workspace managers

Assessment:

- Added progress tracking on videos, the progress indicator is now proportional to the most advanced viewing point in the video.
- It is now possible to send messages to users directly from the Pedagogical follow-up tool of the workspace and resources.
- Added the notion of "evaluated resource" on all resources. In the configuration of a resource you can now check the box "Evaluated" to indicate that the score obtained for the resource contributes to the global score of the workspace. Warning: To be taken into account in the score of the workspace the resource must be "Evaluated" AND "Mandatory".
- In the resource lists, and especially in the widgets, there is now a "mandatory" filter and an "evaluated" filter.
- It is now possible to configure a success threshold for the workspacespace from the "Configure" menu in "More tools".
- Added participation and success certificates for workspaces

Workspace:           

- Merged the "Copy" and "Copy as Template" actions. It is now possible to choose if you want to create a template(s) from the confirmation mode of the "Copy" action. This simplifies and improves the readability of the activity space management menu.
