Changes and improvements in v13.6

General:

- In general, performance improvements have been made to the application. They are not necessarily visible from the interface for the end users but should notably improve the loading times.
- The "Full screen" mode already available from the resources and tools has been revised to increase the immersion of your users in your content. The full screen mode now makes the tools menu on the left and the navigation bar at the top disappear. The cover images and option buttons of the resources and tools are also hidden when switching to full screen.
- A new group "ROLE_USER" has been created, it contains all the users of the platform and will be updated automatically when new users are created. It can be used to automate the registration of new users to a space accessible to all.
- Addition of some missing translations
- Cleaning up obsolete features

Import/Export:

- Added export of activity space managers

Assessment:

- Added progress on videos, the progress indicator is now proportional to the most advanced viewing point in the video.
- It is now possible to send messages to users directly from the pedagogical follow-up of the activity space and resources.
- Added the notion of "evaluated resource" on all resources. In the configuration of a resource you can now check the box "Evaluated" to indicate that the score obtained for the resource contributes to the global score of the space. Warning: To be taken into account in the score of the space the resource must be "Evaluated" AND "Mandatory".
- In the resource lists, and especially in the widgets, there is now a "mandatory" filter and an "evaluated" filter.
- It is now possible to configure a success threshold for the activity space from the "Configure" menu in "More tools".
- Added participation and success certificates for activity spaces

Activity Space:

- Merged the "Copy" and "Copy as Template" actions. It is now possible to choose if you want to create a template(s) from the confirmation mode of the "Copy" action. This simplifies and improves the readability of the activity space management menu.
