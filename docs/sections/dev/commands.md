### Generating migrations

A properly installed platform will include the MigrationBundle.
It includes several usefull commands.

### Plugins management

Plugins are registered with the command:

You can remove plugins with:

```sh

```

**Tips:** The list of registered bundle is saved in the file
**files/config/bundles.ini**.

If you need to add a bundle, you can simply add a line in this file if it
already exists in your vendors. If you don't want a bundle to be instanciated,
you can remove the relevant line here. Errors in the installation may remove the
line concerning the bundle wich crashed (including the ClarolineCoreBundle).

Removing the -a option will create a regular user.
