## Include theme generated files in templates

## Create a custom theme

### From a plugin

Plugins can introduce platform themes. Once a plugin is installed, the theme
it provides becomes available in the *Appearance* section of the general 
parameters of the platform. As this feature is based on template overriding,
a plugin can customize any part of the user interface.

Themes are declared in the `themes` section of the plugin configuration:

```yml
plugin:
  # ...
  themes:
    - name: "Custom Theme"
```
