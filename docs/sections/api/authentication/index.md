# Authentication

## API Token

## Saml

## OAuth

Enables users to connect through social login (facebook, twitter, google, linkedin, windows live, office 365).

### Configuration

In order to enable 3rd party connection (social login) using the OAuth service, you will need to generate a pair of **App key** + **App Secret** for every provider available (for the moment _facebook_, _twitter_, _google_, _linkedin_, _windows live_, _office 365_)

Click on the following links to learn how to configure your App for every provider and eventually retrieve your App key & secret

- [Facebook](sections/api/authentication/facebookAppConfig.md)
- [Twitter](sections/api/authentication/twitterAppConfig.md)
- [Google](sections/api/authentication/googleAppConfig.md)
- [LinkedIn](sections/api/authentication/linkedinAppConfig.md)
- [Windows Live](sections/api/authentication/windowsAppConfig.md)
- [Office 365](sections/api/authentication/office365AppConfig.md)

Once you've created your App and got your keys, it's time to enable login to your Claroline platform.

To enable your social login, let's say _facebook login_ for example:

1. Head over to _Administration_ -> _Platform parameters_
2. Click on **Oauth** option
3. Choose the provider you wish to enable/configure (e.g. _facebook_)
4. Fill in the form with your _application id (App key)_ and your _secret (App secret)_, check _activate_ and then save

**NB: If available you can check the `force re-authentication` option to ask the users to check their identity every time they connect through this provider**  

Your social login is now enabled. You can test it on your login page.

##### ATTENTION! You need to have administration privileges in order to set any platform parameters.

If your App configuration is correct, you should be able to connect using the external login. If you encounter any issues please check your configuration both in the App and in the platform.

If you are still having difficulty connecting through your App, do not hesitate to contact us.
